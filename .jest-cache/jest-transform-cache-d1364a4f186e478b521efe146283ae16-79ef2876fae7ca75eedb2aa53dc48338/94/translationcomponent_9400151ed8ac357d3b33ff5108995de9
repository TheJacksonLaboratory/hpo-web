The Chinese HPO project\n      can be found <a href=\"https://www.chinahpo.net/\"\n                      target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n    </p>\n\n  <h2>Mappings</h2>\n  <p>In contrast to many clinical terminologies, the HPO was purpose-built to\n    facilitate differential diagnostics and scientific investigations such as\n    cross-species comparisons with model organism data from mouse and zebrafish.\n    Moreover, the HPO has an extremely broad coverage of concepts. In an evaluation\n    of HPO content versus the numerous vocabularies integrated within the Unified\n    Medical Language System (UMLS), Winnenburg and Bodenreider showed that the coverage\n    of HPO phenotype concepts in the UMLS is 54% and only 30% in SNOMED CT (ISMB 2014 SIG session\n    cited <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899602\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).\n    The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681409\" target=\"_blank\">UMLS</a>\n    is a terminology integration system developed by the U.S. National Library of\n    Medicine that integrates many standard biomedical terminologies. In\n    order to improve the coverage of phenotype data, the UMLS has now integrated the\n    entire HPO starting with the 2015AB release. This enables an easy process to map\n    HPO-encoded data to standard health-care terminologies such as SNOMED CT. </p>\n\n  <p>HPO has contributed to the establishment of\n    the <a href=\"http://www.irdirc.org/?s=ichpt\" target=\"_blank\">International Consortium of\n      Human Phenotype Terminologies (ICHPT)</a> to provide the community with standards\n    that achieve interoperability among databases incorporating human phenotypic features.\n  </p>\n\n\n</div>\n"
