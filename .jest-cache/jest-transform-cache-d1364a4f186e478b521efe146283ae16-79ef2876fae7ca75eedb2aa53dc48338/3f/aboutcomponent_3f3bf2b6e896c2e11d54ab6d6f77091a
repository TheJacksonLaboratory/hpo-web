The HPO can be used to support\n        differential diagnostics, translational research, and a number of applications in computational biology by providing\n        the means to <em>compute</em> over the clinical phenotype. The HPO is being used for computational deep\n        phenotyping and precision medicine as well as integration of clinical data into translational research.\n        <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504886\" target=\"__blank\">Deep phenotyping</a> can be defined as the\n        precise and comprehensive\n        analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described.\n        The HPO is being increasingly adopted as a standard for\n        phenotypic abnormalities by diverse groups such as international rare disease organizations, registries, clinical\n        labs, biomedical resources, and\n        clinical software tools and will thereby contribute toward nascent efforts at global data exchange for identifying\n        disease etiologies\n        (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899602\" target=\"__blank\">K&ouml;hler et al, 2017</a>).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The HPO currently contains over 18,000 terms arranged in a directed acyclic graph and are connected by is-a\n        (subclass-of) edges, such that a term represents\n        a more specific or limited instance of its parent term(s). All relationships in the HPO are is-a relationships,\n        i.e. simple class-subclass relationships. For instance, <a routerLink=\"/browse/term/HP:0000517\"><em>Abnormal lens\n        morphology</em></a> is-a <a routerLink=\"/browse/term/HP:0012372\"><em>Abnormal eye morphology</em></a>.\n        The relationships are transitive, meaning that they are inherited up all paths to the root.\n        <a routerLink=\"/browse/term/HP:0000118\"><em>Phenotypic abnormality</em></a> is the main\n        subontology of the HPO and contains descriptions of clinical abnormalities.\n        Additional subontologies are provided to describe inheritance patterns, onset/clinical course and modifiers of\n        abnormalities.\n      </p>\n      <button mat-flat-button color=\"primary\" routerLink=\"/browse/term/HP:0000001\">\n        Explore Ontology\n        <mat-icon>keyboard_arrow_right</mat-icon>\n      </button>\n      &nbsp;\n      <a class=\"science-direct\"\n         href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/human-phenotype-ontology\"\n         mat-stroked-button target=\"_blank\">HPO on Science Direct</a>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"about-us-banner flex-[100%] sm:flex-[70%] flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-evenly gap-4\">\n      <div class=\"banner-card\" routerLink=\"/browse/term/HP:0001166\">\n        <div class=\"icon-wrapper\">\n          <mat-icon>travel_explore</mat-icon>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Browse</h3>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"banner-card\" routerLink=\"/resources/publications\">\n        <div class=\"icon-wrapper\">\n          <mat-icon>menu_book</mat-icon>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Publications</h3>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"banner-card\" routerLink=\"/citation\">\n        <div class=\"icon-wrapper\">\n          <mat-icon>history_edu</mat-icon>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Cite Us</h3>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"history flex-[100%] sm:flex-[70%]\">\n      <h3 class=\"sub-title\">Where it started!</h3>\n      <p>The Human Phenotype Ontology was initially developed at the <a href=\"https://www.charite.de/\" target=\"__blank\">Charité University Hospital</a> in Berlin, Germany by\n        Peter N Robinson and Sebastian K&ouml;hler with support from Sandra Doelken and Sebastian Bauer.
