Genomiser scores variants through either\n    existing methods such as CADD or a bespoke machine learning method and combines these with allele frequency,\n    regulatory sequences, chromosomal topological domains, and phenotypic relevance to discover variants associated to\n    specific Mendelian disorders.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>The Genomiser is available as part of the downloadable Java application\n    <a href=\"http://exomiser.monarchinitiative.org/exomiser/\" target=\"_blank\">Exomiser</a>.\n  </p>\n    <img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"assets/tools-images/genomiser.jpg\"/>\n</div>\n"
