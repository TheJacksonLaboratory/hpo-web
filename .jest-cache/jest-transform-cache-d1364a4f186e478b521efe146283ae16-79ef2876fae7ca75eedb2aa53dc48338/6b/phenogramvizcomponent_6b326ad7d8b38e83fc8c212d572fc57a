PhenoGramViz\n    additionally implements a comparison of model organism phenotypes with patient phenotypes\n    in order to support the identification\n    of novel disease genes and medical evaluation of CNVs.\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://phenomics.github.io/software-phenoviz.html\" target=\"_blank\">PhenoGramViz</a>: Automatically\n      analyze and visualize gene-to-phenotype relations for a set of genes affected by CNV of a patient and a set of\n      HPO-terms\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <img class=\"static-images mx-auto\" src=\"assets/tools-images/phenogramviz.jpg\"/>\n</div>\n"
