Optionally, an assumed mode of inheritance is used to further filter genes\n    with variants present in a pattern compatible with the assumed mode of inheritance (e.g., homozygous or compound\n    heterozygous for autosomal recessive). These genes are then assigned a phenotypic relevance score based on\n    comparison with mouse and zebrafish models with mutations in orthologous genes. The final ranking is calculated as\n    the sum of the individual\n    scores to yield the PHIVE score.\n  </p>\n\n  <img class=\"static-images mx-auto\" src=\"assets/tools-images/exomiser1.jpg\"/>\n\n  <p>The Exomiser uses a cross-species phenotype matching algorithm. The user enters a human phenotype as a list of HPO\n    terms.\n    All genes with variants that survive the initial filtering steps are then screened for mouse models with phenotypic\n    to the human disease.\n  </p>\n\n\n  <img class=\"static-images mx-auto\" src=\"assets/tools-images/exomiser2.jpg\"/>\n\n</div>\n"
