It involves the translation of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms into Indigenous languages, including\n    Australian Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander languages in Australia and Indigenous Ghanaian Languages. These\n    translations will enable a more effective and personal approach in communication between health care providers\n    and patients. The complexity of HPO can be lost on most people, therefore translation into language will improve\n    patient understanding of what they’re experiencing. </p>\n  <p>Translations are being completed in partnership between Champions, Elders, community, community medical centres,\n    local language centres and local land councils. This approach strengthens bonds between all the groups involved,\n    ensuring all voices are heard and that community empowerment is achieved.</p>\n  The approach of this initiative will:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Improve rates of diagnosis</li>\n    <li>Educate youth on rare disease and genetic health care</li>\n    <li>Connect youth to culture, and knowledge sharing between younger and older generations</li>\n    <li>Using new technology to connect with ancient knowledge, including through the HPO lingua franca</li>\n    <li>Ensure culturally appropriate health care</li>\n    <li>Retain and empower Indigenous language</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Translations are being completed in partnership between Champions, Elders, community, community medical centres,\n    local\n    language centres and local land councils. This approach strengthens bonds between all the groups involved, ensuring\n    all\n    voices are heard and that community empowerment is achieved.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"row flex flex-row\">\n    <div class=\"w-1/2\">\n      <p>\n        Currently there are several Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages across Australia being translated\n        including:\n      </p>\n      <ul class=\"translation\">\n        <li>Nyangumarta</li>\n        <li>Noongar</li>\n        <li>Badimaya</li>\n        <li>Eastern Arrernte</li>\n        <li>Kija</li>\n        <li>Kala Lagaw Ya and Creol</li>\n        <li>Manyjilyjarra</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  <div class=\"w-1/2\">\n      <img class=\"static-images indigenous\" src=\"assets/indigenous.png\"/>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <p>There are over 290 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language groups across Australia. On average, 1 in 10\n    families speak an Indigenous language at home. In regional parts of Australia, that figure can jump up to 5.8 in 10\n    families. People living in regional parts of Australia also experience a much more different health journey than\n    those living in metropolitan areas, which includes limited access to primary and specialist health care, large\n    distances to travel, referral to hospital specialists often involving travelling to larger metropolitan hospitals\n    usually by way of airplane. This highlights the importance of the need for translations to ensure the effective\n    delivery of health care.</p>\n  <p>Examples of translations completed in Nyangumarta include:</p>\n  <div class=\"flex flex-wrap justify-evenly items-center sm:flex-row\">\n    <div>\n      <strong>HPO Term – Microcephaly</strong>\n      <ul class=\"translation\">\n        <li>Description – Small head circumference</li>\n        <li>Translation – Jurnturtu wupartu</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <strong>HPO Term – Macrocephaly</strong>\n      <ul class=\"translation\">\n        <li>Description – Big head circumference</li>\n        <li>Translation – Jurnturtu wirtu</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <strong>HPO Term – Hypertelorism</strong>\n      <ul class=\"translation\">\n        <li>Description – widely spaced eyes</li>\n        <li>Translation – Pani kakajul</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <strong>HPO Term – Macrostomia</strong>\n      <ul class=\"translation\">\n        <li>Description – wide mouth</li>\n        <li>Translation – Jawa walpurra</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Lyfe Languages continues to grow, evolve and adapt on a daily basis, while gaining popularity and interest on a\n    worldwide scale. Ghana is a country\n    located in the western African Region with a population of about 30 million. Like most African countries, its\n    population is predominantly indigenous\n    with about 100 ethnic groups and over 50 indigenous languages. Currently Rare Disease Ghana Initiative with its Lyfe\n    Language champions are translating\n    the HPO terms into Twi, Ewe, Ga, Dagaare, Dagbani, Kaseem, Nzema and Gonja.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The ultimate goal of this project is to ensure that medical terminology can be explained to patients in a language\n    that they understand, thus ensuring\n    understanding and appropriate care.\n  </p>\n  <a mat-raised-button href=\"http://www.lyfelanguages.com/About.html\" color=\"primary\" target=\"_blank\"\n     class=\"lyfe-language-btn\">Visit the Lyfe Languages Project</a>\n</div>\n"
