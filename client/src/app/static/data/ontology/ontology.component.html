      <p>The <a href="http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/GO.format.obo-1_2.html"
                target="_blank">OBO flat file format</a> is a simple way of representing an
        ontology that models represent a subset of the concepts in the OWL description
        logic language. The OBO format was designed to maximize human readability and has
        been widely used in the field of bio-ontologies and was probably one of the
        many factors responsible for the success of the

      <p>OWL, which stands for <em><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/" target="_blank">Web
        Ontology Language</a></em>, is an ontology language for the semantic web. The
        OWL version of the HPO (which is the primary version) contains some features that the OBO
        version does not, including the logical definitions of HPO classes. Consider
        for instance the following definition of the HPO term for
        <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000483">Astigmatism</a>.
      </p>
      <pre>
  'has part' some
    ('asymmetrically curved'
       and ('inheres in' some cornea)
       and ('has modifier' some abnormal))
   </pre>
      <p>The logical makes use of terms from the <a href="https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato" target="_blank">PATO</a>
        Phenotype And Trait Ontology as well as the <a href="http://uberon.github.io/" target="_blank">UBERON</a>
        cross-species anatomy ontology in order to define
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism" target="_blank">Astigmatism</a></em> as an
        abnormal asymmetric curvature of the cornea. A number of HPO-based algorithms make use of these definitions to
        link to definitions of mouse phenotypes at the <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" target="_blank">Mouse
          Genome Informatics</a>
        resource, for quality control, and other purposes. For many of the HPO algorithms that are primarily
        intended for clinical phenotype matching, these features are not relevant and either the OBO or the OWL format are
        suitable.
