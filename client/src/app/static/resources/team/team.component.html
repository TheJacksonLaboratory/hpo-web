  <h1 class="center pageTitle">Human Phenotype Ontology Team</h1>

  <p>The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has been under development since 2008 and has benefited enormously from a
    team-science approach
    under the auspices of the <a target="__blank" href="https://monarchinitiative.org/">Monarch Initiative</a>,
    establish in 2009. From the beginning, the HPO has worked with clinicians to improve,
    refine, and extend areas of the HPO to meet the needs of clinicians and translational researchers.
    The first such workshop was conducted in 2009 at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute with Professors Helen Firth and
    Nigel Carter.
    This page represents an incomplete list of all those who have made contributions to the HPO (<a

    <h2>OMIM</h2>
    <p>The initial version of the HPO was constructed in 2008 using a file from the
      <a target="__blank" href="https://www.omim.org/">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</a>
      resource by extracting the textual descriptions of each disease as listed in OMIM’s Clinical Synopsis section.
      The HPO was constructed using in-house scripts and Java programs as well as the ontology editing tool
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545183" target="__blank">OBO Edit</a>
      by manually curating all items that occured twice or more in the entire OMIM corpus. We merged synonyms into
      unique HPO terms.
      For instance, the three OMIM descriptions <i>Carpal bone hypoplasia</i>, <i>Hypoplasia of carpal bones</i>, and
      <i>Hypoplastic carpal bones</i> were
      fused into the single term HP:0001498, <i>Carpal bone hypoplasia</i>. Domain knowledge was also used to develop a
      subclass hierarchy
      and to define the necessary general terms, such as <i>Aplasia/hypoplasia of the outer ear</i>, to group more
      specific terms, as well as
      to define links between individual terms. Details about the initial construction of the HPO can be found in the
      <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D865/2574174" target="__blank">initial publication</a>.
      We would like to acknowledge countless constructive interactions with the OMIM team since 2008.<br><br>Ada Hamosh

    <h2>The Phenotype and Trait Ontology Project</h2>
    <p>
      The teams in Berlin and in the UK and US first joined forces in 2009 under the auspices of an NIH-funded project
      that we call the “PATO grant” (2009-2014). Here we laid the foundation for the computational logic that underlies
      the HPO, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and zebrafish phenotype annotations by developing a
      scheme for creating logical definitions of individual phenotypic abnormalities. The framework is based on a
      number of computational resources include the
      <a href="https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato" target="__blank">Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO)</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334586/" target="__blank">Uberon</a> cross-species anatomy
      ontology.
      This framework allows not only computational quality control of the ontologies and annotations but also enables
      cross-species phenotypic comparisons.

    <h2>IRDiRC</h2>
    <p>The International Rare DIseases Research Consortium aims to enable all people living with a rare disease to
      receive
      an accurate diagnosis, care, and available therapy within one year of coming to medical attention. The HPO
      utilized
      by almost all member countries and has been a key source of collaboration, validation, and community
      dissemination.
      HPO has therefore been adopted as a Recommended Resource for use in rare disease diagnostics by the IRDiRC.
