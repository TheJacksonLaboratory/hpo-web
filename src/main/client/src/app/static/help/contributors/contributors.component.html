  <h1 class="center pageTitle">Contributors to the Human Phenotype Ontology</h1>

  <p>The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has been under development since 2008 and has benefited enormously from a team-science approach
    under the auspices of the <a target="__blank" href="https://monarchinitiative.org/">Monarch Initiative</a>, establish in 2009. From the beginning, the HPO has worked with clinicians to improve,
    refine, and extend areas of the HPO to meet the needs of clinicians and translational researchers.
    The first such workshop was conducted in 2009 at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute with Professors Helen Firth and Nigel Carter.
    This page represents an incomplete list of all those who have made contributions to the HPO (<a routerLink="/contact">please let us know</a> about any omissions!).</p>

    <h2>OMIM</h2>
    <p>The initial version of the HPO was constructed in 2008 using a file from the
      <a target="__blank" href="https://www.omim.org/">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</a>
    resource by extracting the textual descriptions of each disease as listed in OMIM’s Clinical Synopsis section.
    The HPO was constructed using in-house scripts and Java programs as well as the ontology editing tool
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545183" target="__blank">OBO Edit</a>
    by manually curating all items that occured twice or more in the entire OMIM corpus. We merged synonyms into unique HPO terms.
      For instance, the three OMIM descriptions <i>Carpal bone hypoplasia</i>, <i>Hypoplasia of carpal bones</i>, and <i>Hypoplastic carpal bones</i> were
    fused into the single term HP:0001498, <i>Carpal bone hypoplasia</i>. Domain knowledge was also used to develop a subclass hierarchy
      and to define the necessary general terms, such as <i>Aplasia/hypoplasia of the outer ear</i>, to group more specific terms, as well as
    to define links between individual terms. Details about the initial construction of the HPO can be found in the
      <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D865/2574174" target="__blank">initial publication</a>.
      We would like to acknowledge countless constructive interactions with the OMIM team since 2008.<br><br>Ada Hamosh <br>Joanna Amberger</p>

    team at the Bar Harbor Campus of the <a href="https://www.jax.org/" target="__blank">Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics</a>
    designed to create compatible logical definitions of the phenotype terms in a way that will allow cross-species phenotype matching

    <h2>The Phenotype and Trait Ontology Project</h2>
    <p>
      The teams in Berlin and in the UK and US first joined forces in 2009 under the auspices of an NIH-funded project
      that we call the “PATO grant” (2009-2014). Here we laid the foundation for the computational logic that underlies
      the HPO, Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, and zebrafish phenotype annotations by developing a
      scheme for creating logical definitions of individual phenotypic abnormalities. The framework is based on a
      number of computational resources include the
      <a href="https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato" target="__blank">Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO)</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334586/" target="__blank">Uberon</a> cross-species anatomy ontology.
      This framework allows not only computational quality control of the ontologies and annotations but also enables cross-species phenotypic comparisons.

    <h2>IRDiRC</h2>
    <p>The International Rare DIseases Research Consortium aims to enable all people living with a rare disease to receive
    an accurate diagnosis, care, and available therapy within one year of coming to medical attention. The HPO utilized
    by almost all member countries and has been a key source of collaboration, validation, and community dissemination.
    HPO has therefore been adopted as a Recommended Resource for use in rare disease diagnostics by the IRDiRC.
