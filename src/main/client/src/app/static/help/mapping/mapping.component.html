  <h2>Translations</h2>
  <p>The HPO has been translated into many languages including (in alphabetical order)
    Chinese, Dutch, French, German,
    Italian, Japanese, Portugese, Russion, Spanish, and Turkish. Some of the
    translations can be downloaded from the
    <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/hpo-translation" target="_blank">HPO
      Translation</a> webpage. Information about the Japanese translation is available
      on the <a href="https://github.com/dbcls/bh16/wiki/HumanPhenotypeOntologyJapanese"
      target="_blank">HPO Japanese GitHub page</a>. The Chinese HPO project
      offers a <a href="http://www.chinahpo.org/wiki/index.php/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5"

  <h2>Mappings</h2>
  <p>In contrast to many clinical terminologies, the HPO was purpose-built to
  facilitate differential diagnostics and scientific investigations such as
   cross-species comparisons with model organism data from mouse and zebrafish.
  Moreover, the HPO  has an extremely broad coverage of concepts. In an evaluation
  of HPO content versus the numerous vocabularies integrated within the Unified
  Medical Language System (UMLS), Winnenburg and Bodenreider showed that the coverage
  of HPO phenotype concepts in the UMLS is 54% and only 30% in SNOMED CT (ISMB 2014 SIG session
  cited <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899602" target="_blank">here</a>).
  The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681409" target="_blank">UMLS</a>
  is a terminology integration system developed by the U.S. National Library of
  Medicine that integrates many standard biomedical terminologies. In
  order to improve the coverage of phenotype data, the UMLS has now integrated the
  entire HPO starting with the 2015AB release. This enables an easy process to map
  HPO-encoded data to standard health-care terminologies such as SNOMED CT. </p>




  <p>HPO has contributed to the establishment of
  the <a href="http://www.ichpt.org" target="_blank">International Consortium of
    Human Phenotype Terminologies (ICHPT)</a> to provide the community with standards
     that achieve interoperability among databases incorporating human phenotypic features.
