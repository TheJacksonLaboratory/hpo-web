  <h2>Translations</h2>
  <p>The HPO has been translated into many languages including (in alphabetical order)
    Chinese, Dutch, French, German,
    Italian, Japanese, Portugese, Russion, Spanish, and Turkish. Some of the
    translations can be downloaded from the
    <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/hpo-translation" target="_blank">HPO
      Translation</a> webpage. Information about the Japanese translation is available
      on the <a href="https://github.com/dbcls/bh16/wiki/HumanPhenotypeOntologyJapanese"
      target="_blank">HPO Japanese GitHub page</a>. The Chinese HPO project
      offers a <a href="http://www.chinahpo.org/wiki/index.php/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5"

  <h3>Lyfe Languages Project</h3>
  <p>Lyfe Languages commenced during the 2019 United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages as part of
    Project Y. It involves the translation of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms into Indigenous languages, including
    Australian Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander languages in Australia and Indigenous Ghanaian Languages. These
    translations will enable a more effective and personal approach in communication between health care providers
    and patients. The complexity of HPO can be lost on most people, therefore translation into language will improve
    patient understanding of what they’re experiencing. </p>
  <p>Translations are being completed in partnership between Champions, Elders, community, community medical centres,
    local language centres and local land councils. This approach strengthens bonds between all the groups involved,
    ensuring all voices are heard and that community empowerment is achieved.</p>

        Currently there are several Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages across Australia being translated including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nyangumarta</li>
        <li>Noongar</li>
        <li>Badimaya</li>
        <li>Eastern Arrernte</li>
        <li>Kija</li>
        <li>Kala Lagaw Ya and Creol</li>
        <li>Manyjilyjarra</li>
      </ul>

  </div>

  <p>There are over 290 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language groups across Australia. On average, 1 in 10
    families speak an Indigenous language at home. In regional parts of Australia, that figure can jump up to 5.8 in 10
    families. People living in regional parts of Australia also experience a much more different health journey than
    those living in metropolitan areas, which includes limited access to primary and specialist health care, large
    distances to travel, referral to hospital specialists often involving travelling to larger metropolitan hospitals
    usually by way of airplane, and the list goes on.</p>
  <p>Examples of translations completed in Nyangumarta include:</p>

  <h2>Mappings</h2>
  <p>In contrast to many clinical terminologies, the HPO was purpose-built to
  facilitate differential diagnostics and scientific investigations such as
   cross-species comparisons with model organism data from mouse and zebrafish.
  Moreover, the HPO  has an extremely broad coverage of concepts. In an evaluation
  of HPO content versus the numerous vocabularies integrated within the Unified
  Medical Language System (UMLS), Winnenburg and Bodenreider showed that the coverage
  of HPO phenotype concepts in the UMLS is 54% and only 30% in SNOMED CT (ISMB 2014 SIG session
  cited <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899602" target="_blank">here</a>).
  The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681409" target="_blank">UMLS</a>
  is a terminology integration system developed by the U.S. National Library of
  Medicine that integrates many standard biomedical terminologies. In
  order to improve the coverage of phenotype data, the UMLS has now integrated the
  entire HPO starting with the 2015AB release. This enables an easy process to map
  HPO-encoded data to standard health-care terminologies such as SNOMED CT. </p>

  <p>HPO has contributed to the establishment of
  the <a href="http://www.irdirc.org/?s=ichpt" target="_blank">International Consortium of
    Human Phenotype Terminologies (ICHPT)</a> to provide the community with standards
     that achieve interoperability among databases incorporating human phenotypic features.
