  <h1 class="center pageTitle">Collaborating with HPO</h1>
  <h2>Contributing</h2>
  <p>
    We welcome the participation of interested colleagues. We have been collaborating with many clinicians and translational researchers to refine and
  extend the HPO resources since 2009, and anticipate continuing this process for the foreseeable future.
  Groups or persons with expert knowledge in a particular domain of human phenotyping in a medical genetics setting are invited to contribute their knowledge on a collaborative basis.
  </p>
  <h2>New term requests</h2>
   <p>The simplest way to contribute to the HPO is to make a new term request on our issue tracker
    <a href="https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues" target="__blank">on Github</a>.
	The following text is intended to serve as a guide for anyone who would like to contribute to the HPO project by making new term requests.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the term you are looking for already exist?</h3>
    <p>First, please look at the current HPO and check whether the term is already there. Use the browser on this website.</p>
    	<h3>Is the term you are looking for a synonym of an existing term?</h3>
    <p>If you do not immediately find the term you are looking for, please look for synonyms. One way of doing this
    is to go to a likely parent of the term and peruse all of the children to spot a likely synonym. For instance, if you are looking for a
    term entitled <em>Defect in the atrial septum</em> and do not find it, go to the term
	<a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0005120">Abnormal cardiac atrium morphology</a>.
    and look through all of the children. With some luck you will find the term
    <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0001631">Atrial septal defect</a> and recognize that <em>Defect in the atrial septum</em> is listed as a synonym of
    <em>Atrial septal defect</em>.
  <h2>Bundled terms</h2>
  <p>
    If you find a description in a publication such as <em>Sparse eyebrows and eyelashes</em>, note that the description is referring to two separate phenotypic features.
  The HPO would encode this using two different terms,  <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0045075">Sparse eyebrow</a>  and
  <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000653">Sparse eyelashes</a>.  The idea is that one HPO term should refer to an <em>atomic</em> phenotypic abnormality rather than
  to a collection of abnormalities observed in an individual patient. Please <em>debundle</em> the description and proceed as described above. This is a central
  tenet of  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504886" target="__blank">Deep phenotyping</a>.

<h2>The distinction between diseases and phenotypes</h2>
<p>The community uses the word <em>phenotype</em> with multiple meanings.
  The HPO defines a disease as an entity that has all four of the following features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>an etiology (whether identified or as yet unknown)</li>
    <li>a time course</li>
    <li>a set of phenotypic features</li>
    <li>if treatments exist, there is a characteristic response to them</li>
  </ul>
  A phenotype (better: <em>phenotypic feature</em>) is a component of a disease. HPO terms can be used to describe the set of
  phenotypic features that characterize a disease. For instance, if the disease is the common cold, then the phenotypes would be runny nose,
  fever, cough, fatigue, etc. Therefore, in the following description:
  <pre>
    a sepsis-like condition with intestinal pseudoobstruction, transient hypoglycemia,
    cholestatic hepatitis, and transient renal failure (maximum plasma creatinine
    132 μmol/L and urea 11 mmol/L at day 5 of life, which normalized on day 10).
  </pre>
  We would conceptualize the "sepsis-like condition" as a disease, and would use HPO terms to describe
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0004389">Intestinal pseudo-obstruction</a> </li>
    <li><a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0001943">Hypoglycemia</a> with the modifier <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0025153">Transient</a>.</li>
    <li><a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0002611">Cholestatic liver disease</a>.</li>
    <li><a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0003259">Elevated serum creatinine</a>.</li>
    <li><a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0003138">Increased blood urea nitrogen</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the HPO considers a disease to be an entity that has a known or unknown cause, is characterized by one or
    more phenotypic features which can affect all or only a subset of individuals with the disease, a time course over
    which the phenotypic features may have onset and evolve, and in some cases one or more indicated treatments and
    a response to treatment. For instance, if the disease entity is the common cold, then the cause is a virus,
    the phenotypic features include fever, cough, runny nose, and fatigue, the time course usually is a relatively
    acute onset with manifestations dragging on for days to about a week, and the treatment may include bed rest, aspirin, or nasal sprays.
  In contrast, a phenotypic feature such as fever is a manifestation of many diseases.
  There is a grey zone between diseases and phenotypic features. For instance, diabetes mellitus can be conceptualized as a disease,
  but it is also a feature of other diseases such as Bardet Biedl syndrome. The HPO takes a practical stance and provides terms for such entities.</p>
  <h2>What is the desired level of granularity of an HPO term?</h2>
  <p>
    In general, each HPO term refers to a recognizable entity that occurs in multiple patients and often in multiple diseases.
    We do not try to create an HPO term for very specific manifestations in individual patients.
    For instance, <em>hamartomatous proliferation containing malformed hair follicles in various stages of development</em> would be too detailed to be a good HPO term.
  </p>
  <h2>Anatomy of an HPO term</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have convinced yourself that the item you need is not already present in the HPO, please provide us with the following information
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Preferred Label: What is the name of the term? This should be the name most commonly used by the community.</li>
    <li>Synonyms. If you are aware of synonyms for you term, please include them in your term request.</li>
    <li>Definition. Please try to formulate a definition of your term that will be comprehensible to non-specialists.</li>
    <li>References. Please include a PubMed ID if possible, so that other users of the HPO can find more informa stion about your term.</li>
    <li> Parent term. If possible, please suggest where your new term should be placed within the existing ontology.
    It is sufficient to write the name(s) of the parent term(s) (i.e., you do not need to tell us the HPO ID,  e.g., HP:1234567).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>HPO Workbench</h2>
  We are developing a new app called <a routerLink="/tools/workbench"> HPO Workbench</a> for making term suggestions. While the app is still in testing stages, it is stable and has been used for production purposes.
HPO Workbench is Java app for working with the HPO that allows users to browse the ontology and disease annotations.
In order to make suggestions, it is possible to make GitHub issues on our tracker directly from HPO Workbench.
Alternatively, it is possible to export Excel files with all terms from a subhierarchy of interest (e.g., all liver-related terms).
