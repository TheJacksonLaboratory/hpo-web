    <h2>Lyfe Languages Project</h2>
    <p>Lyfe Languages commenced during the 2019 United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages as part of
      Project Y. It involves the translation of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms into Indigenous languages, including
      Australian Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander languages in Australia and Indigenous Ghanaian Languages. These
      translations will enable a more effective and personal approach in communication between health care providers
      and patients. The complexity of HPO can be lost on most people, therefore translation into language will improve
      patient understanding of what they’re experiencing. </p>
    <p>Translations are being completed in partnership between Champions, Elders, community, community medical centres,
      local language centres and local land councils. This approach strengthens bonds between all the groups involved,
      ensuring all voices are heard and that community empowerment is achieved.</p>
    The approach of this initiative will:
    <ul>
        <li>Improve rates of diagnosis</li>
        <li>Educate youth on rare disease and genetic health care</li>
        <li>Connect youth to culture, and knowledge sharing between younger and older generations</li>
        <li>Using new technology to connect with ancient knowledge, including through the HPO lingua franca</li>
        <li>Ensure culturally appropriate health care</li>
        <li>Retain and empower Indigenous language</li>
    </ul>

          Currently there are several Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages across Australia being translated including:
        </p>
        <ul class="translation">
          <li>Nyangumarta</li>
          <li>Noongar</li>
          <li>Badimaya</li>
          <li>Eastern Arrernte</li>
          <li>Kija</li>
          <li>Kala Lagaw Ya and Creol</li>
          <li>Manyjilyjarra</li>
        </ul>

    <p>There are over 290 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language groups across Australia. On average, 1 in 10
      families speak an Indigenous language at home. In regional parts of Australia, that figure can jump up to 5.8 in 10
      families. People living in regional parts of Australia also experience a much more different health journey than
      those living in metropolitan areas, which includes limited access to primary and specialist health care, large
      distances to travel, referral to hospital specialists often involving travelling to larger metropolitan hospitals
      usually by way of airplane. This highlights the importance of the need for translations to ensure the effective 
      delivery of health care.</p>
    <p>Examples of translations completed in Nyangumarta include:</p>

        Lyfe Languages continues to grow, evolve and adapt on a daily basis, while gaining popularity and interest on a worldwide scale. Ghana is a country 
        located in the western African Region with a population of about 30 million. Like most African countries, its population is predominantly indigenous 
        with about 100 ethnic groups and over 50 indigenous languages. Currently Rare Disease Ghana Initiative with its Lyfe Language champions are translating 
        the HPO terms into Twi, Ewe, Ga, Dagaare, Dagbani, Kaseem, Nzema and Gonja. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The ultimate goal of this project is to ensure that medical terminology can be explained to patients in a language that they understand, thus ensuring 
        understanding and appropriate care.
