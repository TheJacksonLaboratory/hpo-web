The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project offers a variety of resources for working
with the HPO. Several of the tools generate lists of diseases that best match
a set of HPO terms (some of these tools additionally analyze lists of variants
identified by exome or genome sequencing). The choice of terms made by clinicians
or researchers using the tools can influence the output of the tools, and therefore,
it is important to choose the terms well.
</p>

<h2>How does the HPO define "phenotype"?</h2>
<p>The word phenotype is used with many different meanings. In biology, the most
widely accepted definition of phenotype is <em>the observable traits of an organism</em>.
In medical contexts, however, the word <em>phenotype</em> is more often used to refer to
 some deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior.
 Many phenotypic descriptions in medical publications describe the phenotype in imprecise ways. For instance, a description such as <em>myopathic electromyography</em>
  is used instead of describing the reasons for this diagnosis, which can include
  reduced duration and reduced amplitude of the action potentials, increased
  spontaneous activity with fibrillations, positive sharp waves, or a reduced
  number of motor units in the muscle. In contrast, <strong>deep phenotyping</strong>
  is defined as the precise and   comprehensive analysis of phenotypic abnormalities
  in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described
  (See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504886" target="_blank">Deep Phenotyping for Precision Medicine</a>).
  The HPO strives to provide a computational resource to enable deep phenotyping, and
  many of the HPO-based computational tools exploit deep phenotyping data.</p>


  <h2>What is the distinction between a disease and a phenotypic feature?</h2>
<p>
THe HPO considers a disease to be an entity that has a known or unknown cause,
is characterized by one or more phenotypic features which can affect all or only
a subset of individuals with the disease, a time course over which the phenotypic
features may have onset and evolve, and in some cases one or more indicated treatments
and a response to treatment. For instance, if the disease entity is the common cold,
then the cause is a virus, the phenotypic features include fever, cough, runny nose, and fatigue,
the time course usually is a relatively acute onset with manifestations dragging on for
days to about a week, and the treatment may include bed rest, aspirin, or nasal sprays. </p>
<p>
In contrast, a phenotypic feature, such as fever, is a manifestation (component) of many diseases.
HPO terms therefore do not describe disease entities, but rather the individual manifestations of the diseases.
</p>
<p>
There is a somewhat arbitrary distinction between diseases and phenotypic features. For instance,
<a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000819"><em>Diabetes mellitus</em></a>
 can be conceptualized as a disease, but it is also a feature of other
diseases such as Bardet Biedl syndrome. The HPO takes a practical stance and provides
 terms for such entities. </p>

<h2>How to choose HPO terms for data entry?</h2>
<p>For each phenotype, choose the most specific term possible, based on the
  definition and not simply based
  on the term label. Before selecting a term, examine any of the more specific
   terms contained underneath it (if you are using the browser on this Website to search for terms, follow the links in the
   excerpt of the HPO hierarchy shown on the left side of the HPO term pages).
   If any of those are appropriate, select the more specific term. You do not need to choose both a parent and child term. Some HPO-based software
   allows users to annotations for manifestations that were investigated and specifically not observed
   (e.g., by clicking on a “N”/"No" button).  These "No" annotations are especially useful to
   include in cases where there are only a few observable phenotypes.

<p>
The more specific the item chosen, the better the specificity of the whole phenotypic profile.
 If there are no phenotypes in a given category, consider making a high level "N" (No) annotation.
 For example, if a full visual exam finds no visual impairment, then you could choose N-"Visual impairment".
  Choose terms that are thought to be pathological or unusual, even if they are not so in the greater populace.
  For example, <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000819"><em>Blue irides</em></a>
is a common phenotype in the population, but as an HPO annotation, it is intended to represent "unusually" blue irides given
the population background of an affected individual, e.g., with
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8721568" target="_blank">Williams syndrome</a>.
</p>

<p>Clinicians should also use their judgment in entering terms. For instance, if a patient
  has severe myopia, this feature is more likely to be related to an underlying disease than if
  a patient was found to have a very mild degree of myopia (a feature which is extremely
  common in the population and may just be a coincidence). </p>

  <p>Users of HPO software often ask how many terms they need to enter for HPO-based software to "work". It
    is difficult to provide a general answer to this question, but given that a medical record may contain up to
    hundreds of "abnormal" observations that would be difficult to enter by hand in software, some guidelines can be useful.
    We recommend that users enter HPO terms for all "major" phenotypic abnormalities, perhaps 5-7 in the first round. In some
    cases it may be advisable to enter higher level terms; for instance, in some forms of skeletal dysplasia, affected
    individuals may have several abnormalities of all or most phalanges. Although very specific HPO terms exist for
    these (e.g.,  <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0100436"><em>Bullet-shaped middle phalanx of the 5th toe</em></a> and so on for the other toes),
    it may be preferable to enter   <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0010175"><em>Bullet-shaped toe phalanx</em></a>
    if many phalanges of the toes are affected. We recommend trying several combinations of phenotypes to get a good feeling for
    how term choice can affect the results. </p>




<h2>Patient information</h2>
<p>The HPO project offers a number of demonstration tools on the internet that intend
to show prospective users how to run the tools and interpret the output.
We note that in no case should Protected Health Information
be transmitted to these tools across the internet. Instead, downloadable versions
of these tools (such as the <a routerLink="/tools/exomiser">Exomiser</a>) should
be used behind appropriate firewalls.</p>
