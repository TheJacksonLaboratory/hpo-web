  <p>In clinical settings, phenotypic abnormalities are often defined  using
    medical  terminology,  which  can  be  difficult  for  patients  to
    understand. This so-called terminology
    gap between can impede participation of patients and families in
    research projects concerned with the phenotype or natural history of diseases, and
    can even make it difficult for patients to understand data from their own medical charts.
  </p>
<p>The HPO Project (as part of the <a href="https://monarchinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Monarch Initiative</a>)
    has therefore "translated" the terms of the HPO into "plain language".
    For instance, the term for <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000256"><em>Macrocephaly</em></a> can be translated as
    <em>Large skull</em>.
