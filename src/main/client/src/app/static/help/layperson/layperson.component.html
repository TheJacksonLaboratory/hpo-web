  <p>In clinical settings, phenotypic abnormalities are often defined  using
    medical  terminology,  which  can  be  difficult  for  patients  to
    understand. This so-called terminology
    gap can impede participation of patients and families in
    research projects concerned with the phenotype or natural history of diseases, and
    can even make it difficult for patients to understand data from their own medical charts.
  </p>
<p>The HPO Project (as part of the <a href="https://monarchinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Monarch Initiative</a>)
    has therefore "translated" the terms of the HPO into "plain language".
    For instance, the term for <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000256"><em>Macrocephaly</em></a> can be translated as
    <em>Large skull</em>. A report about the layperson HPO terminology was published in
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632381" target="__blank">Nature Genetics</a> and an
  open-access preprint version is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1168737" target="__blank" >here</a>.
  </p>
  The layperson translations are included in the main HPO release files. For instance, in the hp.obo file the term for
  Macrocephaly contains synonyms that are marked as layperson (the following is an excerpt of the entire entry for the term):

  <pre>
    [Term]
    id: HP:0000256
    name: Macrocephaly
    def: "Occipitofrontal (head) circumference greater than 97th centile compared to appropriate, age matched,
    sex-matched normal standards. Alternatively, a apparently increased size of the cranium." [pmid:19125436]
    comment: Macrocephaly can be due to hydrocephalus (increased CFSF), megalencephaly (increased brain volume) or
    thickening of the skull. Head circumference is measured from just above the glabella
    (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) to the most posterior prominent point of
    the occipital bone using a tape measure. Some standard charts are organized by centiles [Hall et al. [2007]], others
    by standard deviations [Farkas, [1981]]. It is important to add an indication of how far above the normal standard
    the head circumference is if an accurate assessment of this can be made. Macrocephaly is an absolute term.
    The term relative macrocephaly can be used when the head size centile exceeds the centile for height, for example,
    head size at the 75th centile with height at the 5th centile for age and sex.
