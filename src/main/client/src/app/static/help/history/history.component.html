  <h1 class="center pageTitle">A short history of the Human Phenotype Ontology</h1>

  <p>The Human Phenotype Ontology was intially developed at the <a href="https://www.charite.de/" target="__blank">Charit&‌eacute; University Hospital</a> in Berlin, Germany by
  Peter N Robinson and Sebastian K&ouml;hler with support from Sandra Doelken and Sebastian Bauer. Very soon after the
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18950739" target="__blank">initial publication</a>  of the
  HPO in 2008, a collaboration was initiated with researchers from the <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/" target="__blank">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL</a>,
   Chris Mungall, Suzi Lewis, and Nicole Washington, and from the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="__blank">University of Cambridge</a>, Michael Ashburner
    Paul Schofield, George Gkoutos, the <a href="https://uoregon.edu/" target="__blank">University of Oregon</a>, Melissa Haendel, Monte Westerfield,
     who had developed a scheme for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774506/" target="__blank">Linking human diseases
    to animal models using ontology-based phenotype annotation</a>. In parallel, the DECIPHER and later DDD project at the
    <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="__blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> led by Helen Firth and Matt Hurles, conducted clinical
    workshops to extend the HPO and have provided an enormous amount of support and input in subsequent years.
  </p>
  <p>
  The initially unfunded collaboration grew over the years, and has now become the <a href="https://monarchinitiative.org/" target="__blank">Monarch Initiative</a>, now an NIH-supported
  project that aims to integrate biological information using semantics, and to use computational reasoning to
  enable phenotype comparison both within and across species, with the ultimate goal of improving biomedical research. The Monarch Initiative is led by Melissa Haendel, Chris Mungall and Peter Robinson,
  Many researchers in these labs have made major contributions to the HPO.
  </p>
  <p>The HPO has developed a close collaboration with the developers of the <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/mp_ontology/" target="__blank">Mammalian Phenotype Ontology</a>,
  including Cynthia Smith and Sue Bello. The HPO has additionally collaborated closey with
researchers from <a href="https://zfin.org/" target="__blank">ZFIN (The Zebrafish Information Network)</a>, Monte Westerfield,
    Barbara Ruef, Yvonne Bradford. All three groups have developed interoperable phenotype ontology design patterns to enable powerful
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974665/" target="__blank">cross-species phenotype analysis</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Several key collaborations have emerged over the years. Damian Smedley and Jules Jacobsen, initially at the Sanger Institute and now at Queen Mary's University in London
  as well as Genomics England (<a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/" target="__blank">100,000 Genomes project</a>) are collaborating with Peter Robinson's group
  on the development of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26562621" target="__blank">Exomiser</a> and
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27569544" target="__blank">Genomiser</a>. Tudor Groza at the
  <a href="https://www.garvan.org.au/" target="__blank">Garvan Institute</a> has developed powerful tools for phenotype text mining and phenotype data entry
  (<a href="http://www.patientarchive.org/#/home" target="__blank">Patient Archive</a>).</p>
  <p>Peter Robinson moved to the <a href="https://www.jax.org/" target="__blank">Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine</a>, in Famington CT, USA, in 2016, where he is continuing work on the HPO. Sebastian K&ouml;hler has now obtained
  an independent junior professorship at the Charit&‌eacute;. </p>
