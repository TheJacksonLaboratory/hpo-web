    <p>
      A number of annotation files (e.g. phenotype_annotation.tab) are available on our
      <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/">Hudson/Jenkins page</a>.
      The format of the annotation file is explained <a routerLink="/help/annotations">here</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/artifact/misc/phenotype_annotation.tab" target="__blank">phenotype_annotation.tab</a>: contains manual and semi-automated annotations created by the HPO-team. These are annotations of OMIM-, Orphanet-, and DECIPHER-entries</li>
      <li><a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/artifact/misc/phenotype_annotation_hpoteam.tab" target="__blank">phenotype_annotation_hpoteam.tab</a>: contains annotations made explicitly and manually by the HPO-team (mostly referring to OMIM entries)</li>
      <li><a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/artifact/misc/negative_phenotype_annotation.tab" target="__blank">negative_phenotype_annotation.tab</a>: contains negative annotations (i.e. a disease is NOT associated with this HPO-term)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Furthermore, we <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastStableBuild/" target="__blank">provide files</a> that link genes and phenotypes in different ways.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/annotation/ALL_SOURCES_ALL_FREQUENCIES_genes_to_phenotype.txt"
             target="__blank">ALL_SOURCES_ALL_FREQUENCIES_genes_to_phenotype.txt</a>  provides a link between genes and HPO terms. All phenotype terms associated with any disease that is
        associated with variants in a gene are assigned to that gene in this file. Other files are available on our Jenkins server that filter terms according to provenance of the
        annotation and frequency of the features in the disease.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/annotation/ALL_SOURCES_ALL_FREQUENCIES_phenotype_to_genes.txt"
             target="__blank">ALL_SOURCES_ALL_FREQUENCIES_phenotype_to_genes.txt</a> is analogous, but instead provides links from HPO terms to genes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These files are updated at once every month. </p>

    <p><strong>The HPO project is transitioning to a new annotation format in 2018. A detailed description of the new format can be found <a href="http://hpo-annotation-qc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/annotationFormat.html#new-and-old-big-file-formats" target="__blank">here</a>.
      This format will become the main release format later this year following an additional testing and feedback phase.</strong></p>
