  <p>Unless we instruct the computer otherwise, there is no implication that an HPO term such as <i>Cerebral calcification</i> is somehow related to the <i>human brain</i>. The HPO term can be related to other terms in the ontology by subclass relations, but it is not explicitly related to concepts from anatomy, histology, pathology, 
    biochemistry, and cellular physiology. For this reason, a consortium including Sandra Dölken, Sebastian Köhler, and Peter N Robinson from the Institute of Human Genetics and Medical Genetics of the Charité Berlin, Chris Mungall and Suzi Lewis from the Berkely Bioinformatics Open Source Projects group, Barbara Ruef 
    and Monte Westerfield from the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN), and Melissa Haendel, Nicole Vasilevsky and Mark Engelstad from the Oregon Health & Science University has joined forces to develop computer-readable logical definitions of HPO terms that will allow human phenotypic abnormalities to be related 
    to entities from anatomy, pathology, physiology, biochemistry, and other areas.</p>
    <p>We are creating the definitions using the <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html" target="__blank">Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO)</a>. We logically define phenotypes by stating that classes in the HPO are logically equivalent to Entity/Quality descrisptions, with each such description consisting of the following elements: Q, the type of quality (characteristic) 
      that the genotype affects; E, the type of entity that bears the quality; E2, an additional optional entity type, for relational qualities; M, a modifier. The basic methodology has been described <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/2-30/v2" target="__blank">in this paper.</a></p>
