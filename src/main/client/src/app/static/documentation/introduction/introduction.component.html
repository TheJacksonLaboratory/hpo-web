    The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) intends to offer a tool that will allow large-scale computational analysis of the human phenome. The HPO currently contains over 11,000 terms, each of which describes an individual phenotypic anomaly. 
    The terms are arranged in a directed acyclic graph and are connected by is-a (subclass-of) edges, such that a term represents a more specific or limited instance of its parent term(s). All relationships in the HPO are is-a relationships, 
    i.e. simple class-subclass relationships. For instance, Abnormality of the feet is-a Abnormality of the lower limbs. The relationships are transitive, meaning that they are inherited up all paths to the root. 
    Phenotypic abnormality is the main subontology of the HPO and contains descriptions of clinical abnormalities. Additional subontologies are provided to describe inheritance patterns, onset/clinical course and modifiers of abnormalities.

    <p><em>What is An Ontology and What Use is An Ontology for Medical Genetics Research?</em></p>
    <p>
      The word ontology is derived from Greek words meaning the study of existance and being. More recently, the word ontology has been used in computer science to describe systems that describe concepts within some domain and relationships
      between those concepts. The Gene Ontology consortium has developed an extensive ontology describing molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular locations over the last decade and a number of groups have supplied annotations 
      using the GO terms to gene products of many organisms. The study of human phenotypes in the context of hereditary and common disease has the potential to lead to great insight on the function of genes and genetic networks.
      The HPO intends to offer such a computational tool that will allow large-scale computational analysis of the human phenome.

    <p><em>What is the Medical Focus of the Human Phenotype Ontology?</em></p>
    <p>
      Currently, the most useful and comprehensive database of human hereditary disorders is the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. OMIM contains clinical data on several thousand primarily monogenic hereditary disorders. 
      Since OMIM and its predecesor Mendelian Inheritance in Man (McKusick) were initially developed over 30 years ago, OMIM did not use a controlled vocabulary to describe clinical features, and uses a more or less simple hierarchical scheme 
      to assign clinical features to organ systems. Despite these drawbacks, OMIM was and will continue to be an incredibly useful resource for clinicians and researchers. We have therefore mapped nearly all clinical descriptions in OMIM to 
      terms of the HPO. We have embedded these mappings into an ontological, multi-tiered structure that is described below and intend to continue refining and improving the HPO. We have also annotated all Orphanet entries and over 60 recurrent 
      syndromes in DECIPHER.

    <p><em>Terms in the Human Phenotype Ontology</em></p>
    <p>
      Each term in the HPO describes a clinical abnormality. These may be general terms, such as <em>Abnormality of the musculoskeletal system</em> or very specific such as <em>Chorioretinal atrophy</em>. 
      Each term is also assigned to one of the four ontologies, <em>Phenotypic abnormality</em>, <em>Clinical modifier</em>, <em>Mortality/Aging</em> or <em>Mode of inheritance</em>. Most of the terms of the HPO belong to the 
      <em>Phenotypic abnormality</em> ontology. The terms have a unique ID such as <em>HP:0001140</em> and a label such as <em>Epibulbar dermoids</em>.  Most terms have textual definitions such as <em>An epibulbar dermoid is a benign tumor 
      typically found at the junction of the cornea and sclera (limbal epibullar dermoid).</em> The source of the definition must be indicated. Many terms have synonyms. For instance, <em>Epibulbar dermoid</em> is taken to be a synonym of 
      <em>Epibulbar dermoids</em>.

    <p><em>The Structure of the Human Phenotype Ontology</em></p>
    <p>
      Most ontologies are structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which are similar to hierarchies but differ in that a more specialized term (child) can be related to more than one less specialized term (parent).  
      Cycles (cyclic paths in the graph) are not allowed. The relationship of the terms of the HPO to one another is displayed in the DAG. For instance, the term <em>Aplasia/Hypoplasia of metatarsal bones</em> is a child of both 
      <em>Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving bones of the feet</em> and <em>Abnormalities of the metatarsal bones</em>. The ability to encode multiple parents in a DAG adds to the flexibility and descriptiveness of the ontology. 
      For instance, it is possible to search for all terms involving <em>Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the skeleton</em> as well as to search for all terms involving <em>Abnormalities of the foot</em>. 
      This would not be possible with a simple hierarchical system. The <strong>is-a</strong> relationship is transitive, meaning that annotations are inherited up all paths to the root. For instance, 
      <em>Abnormality of the lower limbs</em> <strong>is-a</strong> <em>Abnormality of the extremities</em>, and thus <em>Abnormality of the feet</em> also <strong>is-a</strong> <em>Abnormality of the extremities</em>.
