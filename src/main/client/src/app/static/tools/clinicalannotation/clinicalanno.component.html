<h1>Patient archive</h1>

<p>
Patient Archive (PA) is a platform part of the Monarch suite that focuses on accurate clinical phenotyping to facilitate disease stratification and exploration of the candidate gene space. PA uses the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to create structured patient phenotype profiles and supports both bottom-up, as well as top-down (prescriptive) phenotyping. The former emulates the standard clinical workflow and is driven by the automatic extraction of HPO concepts from free text. The latter, starts from a provided disease model and enables clinicians to create a structured profile by externalizing the alignment between this model and the phenotypes exhibited by the patient. Additional analytical capabilities are provided via HPO-driven semantic similarity matching algorithms. These can be used for a variety of tasks, ranging from patient matchmaking or disorder exploration to personalized gene list generation to power the variant filtering / prioritization process. Patient Archive provides a seamless solution for the harmonization of phenomic information to enable the acceleration of translational and clinical applications.
