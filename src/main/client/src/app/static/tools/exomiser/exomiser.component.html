  Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has revolutionized research into novel disease-gene discovery
However, many cases remain unsolved due to the sheer number of candidate variants remaining after common filtering strategies
such as removing low quality and common variants and those deemed unlikely to be pathogenic.
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24162188" target="_blank">Exomiser</a> filters a whole-exome data
  set by removing off-target, common, and synonymous variants from
  further consideration and evaluates the remaining variants based on the predicted pathogenicity and minor
  allele frequency (variant score). Optionally, an assumed mode of inheritance is used to further filter genes
  with variants present in a pattern compatible with the assumed mode of inheritance (e.g., homozygous or compound
  heterozygous for autosomal recessive). These genes are then assigned a phenotypic relevance score based on
  comparison with mouse and zebrafish models with mutations in orthologous genes. The final ranking is calculated as
  the sum of the individual
   scores to yield the PHIVE score.

<p>The Exomiser uses a cross-species phenotype matching algorithm. The user enters a human phenotype as a list of HPO terms.
  All genes with variants that survive the initial filtering steps are then screened for mouse models with phenotypic
   to the human disease.
