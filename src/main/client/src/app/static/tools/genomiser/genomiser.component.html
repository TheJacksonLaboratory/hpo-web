  <p>
    The interpretation of non-coding variants still constitutes a major challenge in the application of whole-genome
    sequencing in Mendelian disease, especially for single-nucleotide and other small non-coding variants.
    The Genomiser, an analysis framework that is able not only to score the relevance of variation in the non-coding genome,
    but also to associate regulatory variants to specific Mendelian diseases. Genomiser scores variants through either
    existing methods such as CADD or a bespoke machine learning method and combines these with allele frequency,
    regulatory sequences, chromosomal topological domains, and phenotypic relevance to discover variants associated to
    specific Mendelian disorders.
