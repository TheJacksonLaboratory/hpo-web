                The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality, 
                such as atrial septal defect. The HPO is currently being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM. HPO currently contains approximately 11,000 terms (still growing) 
                and over 115,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. The HPO also provides a large set of HPO annotations to approximately 4000 common diseases.

                        <p>Monarch's philosophy is based on the premise that we want to make all the data count. Monarch isnâ€™t just another database that slurps data from the typical places and renders it in a different format. 
                        We are driven to truly integrate biological information using semantics, and present it in a novel way, leveraging phenotypes to bridge the knowledge gap. Our niche is the use of computational reasoning to enable phenotype
                        comparison both within and across species, with the ultimate goal of improving biomedical research.</p>
