      <p>
        The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project provides an ontology of medically relevant phenotypes,
        disease-phenotype annotations, and the algorithms that operate on these. The HPO can be used to support
        differential diagnostics, translational research, and a number of applications in computational biology by providing
        the means to <em>compute</em> over the clinical phenotype. The HPO is being used for computational deep
        phenotyping and precision medicine as well as integration of clinical data into translational research.
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504886" target="__blank">Deep phenotyping</a> can be defined as the
        precise and comprehensive
        analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described.
        The HPO is being increasingly adopted as a standard for
        phenotypic abnormalities by diverse groups such as international rare disease organizations, registries, clinical
        labs, biomedical resources, and
        clinical software tools and will thereby contribute toward nascent efforts at global data exchange for identifying
        disease etiologies
        (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899602" target="__blank">K&ouml;hler et al, 2017</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The HPO currently contains over 18,000 terms arranged in a directed acyclic graph and are connected by is-a
        (subclass-of) edges, such that a term represents
        a more specific or limited instance of its parent term(s). All relationships in the HPO are is-a relationships,
        i.e. simple class-subclass relationships. For instance, <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000517"><em>Abnormal lens
        morphology</em></a> is-a <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0012372"><em>Abnormal eye morphology</em></a>.
        The relationships are transitive, meaning that they are inherited up all paths to the root.
        <a routerLink="/browse/term/HP:0000118"><em>Phenotypic abnormality</em></a> is the main
        subontology of the HPO and contains descriptions of clinical abnormalities.
        Additional subontologies are provided to describe inheritance patterns, onset/clinical course and modifiers of
        abnormalities.

    <h3 class="sub-title">Where it started!</h3>
    <p>The Human Phenotype Ontology was initially developed at the <a href="https://www.charite.de/" target="__blank">ChariteÃÅ University Hospital</a> in Berlin, Germany by
      Peter N Robinson and Sebastian K&ouml;hler with support from Sandra Doelken and Sebastian Bauer. Very soon after the
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18950739" target="__blank">initial publication</a>  of the
      HPO in 2008, a collaboration was initiated with researchers from the <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/" target="__blank">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>
      (Chris Mungall, Suzi Lewis, and Nicole Washington), the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="__blank">University of Cambridge</a> (Michael Ashburner
      Paul Schofield, George Gkoutos), and the <a href="https://uoregon.edu/" target="__blank">University of Oregon</a> (Melissa Haendel, Monte Westerfield).
      These groups have developed a scheme for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774506/" target="__blank">Linking human diseases
        to animal models using ontology-based phenotype annotation</a>. In parallel, the DECIPHER project at the
      <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="__blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> led by Helen Firth and Matt Hurles, conducted clinical
      workshops to extend the HPO and have provided an enormous amount of support and input in subsequent years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initially unfunded collaboration grew over the years, and has now become the <a href="https://monarchinitiative.org/" target="__blank">Monarch Initiative</a>, now an NIH-supported
      project that aims to integrate biological information using semantics, and to use computational reasoning to
      enable phenotype comparison both within and across species, with the ultimate goal of improving biomedical research.
